## Part 1: Imaging Tchnique Inspiration
### I have found some ways to express **pixel art**. Generally speaking, the image resolution is low and the contrast is strong. I think this style can add a sense of nostalgia and fun to my works, and is suitable for making simple game interfaces or interactive animations.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
### I found a program called Pixel Painter. This sketch turns an image into a digital painting. Every frame, it chooses a random pixel from the original image, and then draws a dot with that pixel’s color. I think the constantly emerging dots are very suitable for creating a sense of breathing in the picture and are very suitable for depicting water surfaces or wind.
